        <p>
          Once a user creates a post or course, the admin will review and
          approve or reject it. Approved posts appear in the feed. In the course
          section, you can enroll in courses but cannot access the ones you
          created. In the job section, if you want a job, you need to send a
          proposal. The post owner can accept or reject it, and the same process
          applies to skill posts.

        <p>
          If the post owner accepts your proposal, you can message and negotiate
          the details. Set a price and handle payments through the chat, similar
          to platforms like OLX. You can send offers, and if accepted, the
          transaction proceeds through the Razorpay interface. This is how
          Al-Midan works.
